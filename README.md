## Project about Multithreading in C

The Philosophers project is about reproducing the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, focusing on __concurrency, synchronization, and resource management__.
Each philosopher runs in its own __thread__, sharing forks protected by __mutexes__ to avoid __deadlocks__ and __data races__.

In the bonus part, philosophers become separate __processes__ communicating via __semaphores__, exploring __inter-process synchronization__.
