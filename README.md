### Project about Multithreading in C

The Philosophers project is about reproducing the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, focusing on concurrency, synchronization, and resource management.
Each philosopher runs in its own thread, sharing forks protected by mutexes to avoid deadlocks and data races.

In the bonus part, philosophers become separate processes communicating via semaphores, exploring inter-process synchronization.
