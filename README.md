### Project about Multithreading in C

The Philosophers project tackles the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, focusing on concurrency, synchronization, and resource management.
Each philosopher runs in its own thread, sharing forks protected by mutexes to avoid deadlocks and race conditions.

In the bonus part, philosophers become separate processes communicating via semaphores, exploring inter-process synchronization at a deeper level.
